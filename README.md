# select-om-all

Flexible select-style component for use in Om apps.

See it in action: http://www.condense.com.au/select-om-all/demo/

## Overview

This is a library written in clojurescript based using Om.  It can be used to provide
select-style inputs for HTML forms.

## Rationale

HTML Select fields are quite limited and most webapps projects demand something
more than they provide to help the user or improve performance.

We were driven by the need for some specific features:

* Handling thousands of select options efficiently
* Auto complete style filtering of select options
* Showing results in a grid format

Plenty of JS libraries have been created to try and address this, for example:

* Harvest Chosen was an innovation in its day
* Select2 is more modern popular solution
* Commercial libraries such as DevExpress have SearchBox and EditBox style inputs  
* Google Closure itself provides auto complete features

Attempts have been made to wrap these neatly into React components.  This library
aims to provide an Om native solution to your better-than-select input needs.

More recently Facebook released fixed-data-table which provides an efficient 
component for large tables of data.  We use this in our solution.
